                    <p1 class="aboutparagraph1">Dengue fever was known by several names throughout the world, it was
                        first called as “dengue” in Spanish from around 1800. This kind of disease originated from China
                        at around 992A.D. and described as ‘water poison’ at that time. The very first severe form of
                        dengue was on Thailand and Philippines during the 1950s. The record noted this disease usually
                        associated with flying insects. </p1>

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <p2 class="aboutparagraph1">As for history of dengue in Malaysia, the first ever known dengue
                        outbreak was on November 15, 1902. By early 1970s, the dengue fever has already spread to the
                        whole Malaysia and has since caused a significant health burden to the population of Malaysia.
                        In year 2012 World Health Organization (WHO) classified dengue as the most transmittable disease
                        by mosquitoes. At the same time, it was also the most rapidly and widely spreading
                        mosquito-borne disease worldwide. In Malaysia, factors like population growth in urban areas
                        become the main media for the disease to spread as dengue fever is predominantly an urban
                        disease. Closer proximity and high densities of susceptible host making the disease to spread
                        easier. In short, dengue is common in more than 100 countries around the world and about 3
                        billion of people live in area with a risk of dengue. And each year, up to 400 million people
                        get infected with dengue and among them, 22000 die from severe form of dengue. </p2>

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <p3 class="aboutparagraph1">Speaking of dengue fever, the key facts about this disease can be
                        simplified into 3 points. First, about one in four of infected person with the disease will get
                        sick. Second, those sick people with dengue symptoms can be mild or severe. Lastly, severe
                        dengue can be life-threatening within a few hours and needs emergency care in the hospital.
                        Dengue transmission mostly caused by mosquitoes’ bite from infected Aedes species mosquitoes,
                        which is the same species that spread Zika and chikungunya viruses. Mosquitoes become infected
                        when thy bite infected person and spread to others person through bites. In some special
                        situation, infected mother will also pass the virus to the fetus during pregnancy or
                        breastfeeding. Then, to identify the disease, its symptoms have to be clarified. </p3>

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <p4 class="aboutparagraph1">Due to lack of understanding, mild symptoms of dengue can be confused
                        with other illnesses that can causes fever, aches and pains on body parts. However, the most
                        common symptom of dengue is fever coming along with any among nausea and vomiting, rashes, aches
                        and pains which is typically behind our eyes, muscle, joint or bone pain. On the other hand,
                        things can get much more horrible when it comes to severe form of dengue disease. Severe dengue
                        usually found about 1 in 20 people who get sick with the dengue infected people and can result
                        in shock, internal bleeding and even death. Symptom of severe dengue typically called as warning
                        sign and patient required immediately sent to the local clinic or emergency room if any of it
                        appears. These symptoms are belly pain, tenderness, vomiting at least 3 times in 24 hours,
                        bleeding from the nose or gums, vomiting blood or blood in the stool and feeling tired restless
                        or irritable.
